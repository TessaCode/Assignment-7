# Assignment-7
Repo for a review of my favorite R package, GGAnimate!

## GGAnimate

## Availability
Available on both CRAN (use install.packages("gganimate") and GitHub (install_github('thomasp85/gganimate'))

## Vignettes
GGAnimate has a vignette that includes function definitions, examples of code and the graph outcomes. It also explains how to find your animation, and provides options for additional rendering formats. 

## Applications
There are many blogs that describe the usefulness of gganimate including posts from solarchemist, Medium, R-bloggers, and others that highlight the usefulness of the package.

## Review

The purpose of this package is to add animation to an otherwise static graphic. This package allows you animate points to easily show how data changes over time. I like how it builds off of ggplot and is easy to implement on graphs that are already coded. I like how much online chatter there is about this package, it makes it easy to get ideas on how to use it effectively. That being said, it seems that folks online struggle with getting animations to work without additional packages installed. I haven't run into these errors but it shows that in some instances, gganimate isn't as easy as it seems. Overall, I would definitely recommend this package to someone! The graphics produced by this package would be perfect to include in a presentation or on a project website.
